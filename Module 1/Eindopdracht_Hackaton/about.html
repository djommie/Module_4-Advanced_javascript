        <h1>Giant panda</h1>
        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear
            or simply the panda, is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised by its bold
            black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the
            red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
            with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will
            occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In
            captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially
            prepared food</p>
        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring
            Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has
            been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable
            species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the
            country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13
            different countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590
            individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be
            as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the
            rise. In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had
            increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered" to
            "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.</p>
        <h1>Taxonomy</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares
            characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a
            true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from
            the common ancestor of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all
            other extant bear species. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.</p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the
            French word panda has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to
            the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this
            name to the red panda.</p>
        <p>In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the lesser-known red panda,[24] thus
            necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the
            Encyclopædia Britannica still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear, and simply "panda" for
            the red panda, despite the popular usage of the word "panda" to refer to giant pandas.</p>
        <p>Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different
            names, such as huāxióng (花熊 "spotted bear") and zhúxióng (竹熊 "bamboo bear"). The most popular names in
            China today are dàxióngmāo (大熊貓 literally "giant bear cat"), or simply xióngmāo (熊貓 "bear cat"). The name
            xióngmāo (熊貓 "bear cat") was originally used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since the
            giant panda was thought to be closely related to the red panda, dàxióngmāo (大熊貓) was named relatively.
